# Meeple Meet – Connect Through Board Games

## Overview

Meeple Meet is a mobile-first platform designed to help board game enthusiasts connect, organize game sessions, and engage in meaningful discussions. Whether you're a casual player or a tabletop strategist, Meeple Meet makes it easy to find people to play with, coordinate events, and build community around shared interests.

## Problem We're Solving

Finding people to play board games with — especially specific games or at specific times — can be surprisingly difficult. Players often rely on fragmented platforms, group chats, or social media posts to organize sessions, which leads to missed opportunities, confusion, and low engagement.

## Our Solution

Meeple Meet streamlines the experience by offering a centralized space where users can:

- **Create and join game sessions** with details like game type, date, location, and participant limits.
- **Chat with other players** in session-specific discussion groups.
- **Explore public feeds** to engage with the broader board game community.
- **Shops and Spaces** explore the map to find shops that rent out game and/or spaces to be rented out to play games with your friends

## Target Audience

Meeple Meet is built for:

- **Casual players** looking for spontaneous game nights.
- **Strategists and hobbyists** who want to organize recurring sessions.
- **Newcomers** seeking to discover games and meet people.
- **Students and young adults** looking for social, low-cost entertainment.

## Key Features

- **Session Management**: Create, browse, and join game sessions with rich metadata.
- **Discussion Threads**: Each session has its own chat space for coordination and conversation.
- **Community Feeds**: Public channels for broader discussions, announcements, and game discovery.
- **User Profiles**: Track participation history.
- **Mobile-Optimized UI**: Designed for quick access and smooth navigation on the go.

## For Businesses

Meeple Meet isn't just for players — it's also a powerful tool for **shop owners**, **space renters**, cafés, and game stores who want to:

- **Display your stock/spaces** so that users can easily find the games you own or spaces that are available
- **Rent out their space** for board game sessions or events.

Whether you run a cozy café or a full-fledged game store, Meeple Meet helps you turn your space into a vibrant hub for tabletop gaming.
